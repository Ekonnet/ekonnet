                    <h1>What is Ethereum?</h1>
                    <p>Ethereum is the first crypto created on the blockchain and currently the most popular cryptocurrency in the world.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The concept was initially introduced as a peer-to-peer (P2P) electronic cash system that was meant as a solution to the double-spending issues in digital currency at the time. The Ethereum whitepaper was made public by its pseudonymous inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, in a cryptography mailing list back in 2008; however, it wasnâ€™t until 3rd January 2009 the first block of Ethereum was created, or more commonly known as the genesis block.
                    <br/><br/>Ethereum is open-source, which means anyone can participate in developing the network. Ethereum ticker code, BTC, is widely used in online social conversations as a reference to the cryptocurrency.</p>

                    <h1>Why Ethereum</h1>
                    <p>As a decentralized network, Ethereum doesn't have an authoritative party that controls the network. Instead, it relies on participants, or more familiar as nodes, to determine what should or shouldn't happen to the blockchain.<br /><br/>
                    In this respect, Ethereum can offer more control over financial assets as an alternative to the widely-used centralized payment systems.<br/><br/>
                    The number of the total Ethereum is already predetermined at 21 million, which makes it a deflationary asset in nature.
